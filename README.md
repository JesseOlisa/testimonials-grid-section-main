## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have been using grid for a while now but i usually arrange the grid boxes manually. However, while working on this challenge, i learnt how to use grid template areas to arrange items using css grids. My code was much neater and shorter and easy to manipulate too.

### Continued development

CSS is tricky and i come across new things everyday. My aim is contiuned to learn and understand css. I still think there's more to grid than i know now.
